About Dataset

Context
A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages, and household products,
organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores
but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In
everyday U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is synonymous with supermarket, and is not used to refer to
other types of stores that sell groceries.
